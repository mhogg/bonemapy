#bonemapy

**An ABAQUS plug-in to map bone properties from CT scans to 3D finite element bone/implant models. This is typically used for applying heterogeneous material properties to the bone model**

## Requirements

### Software requirements

* ABAQUS  >= 6.11
* pydicom >= 0.9.7

**NOTES:**

1.  ABAQUS is a commerical software package and requires a license from [Simulia](http://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/overview/)
2.  The authors of bonemapy are not associated with ABAQUS/Simulia 
3.  bonemapy uses both Python and numpy, which are built in to ABAQUS. All of the last few releases of ABAQUS (v6.11 - v6.13) use Python 2.6 and numpy 1.4

### Model setup requirements

* The model must be open in the current viewport
* The model must contain only tetrahedral elements. All 3D stress tetrahedral elements are supported (ABAQUS element types C3D4, C3D4H, C3D10, C3D10H, C3D10I, C3D10M, and C3D10MH).
* Requires that the model coordinates match the CT scan coordinates e.g. the bone model cannot be shifted from its original position

### CT stack requirements ###

* All CT slices should be located in the same directory. This directory must not contain any other file types or slices belonging to other stacks.  
* It is assumed that all slices have the same origin (i.e. same x,y coordinate)
