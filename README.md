#bonemapy

**An ABAQUS plug-in to map bone properties from CT scans to 3D finite element bone/implant models. This is typically used for applying heterogeneous material properties to the bone model**

## Requirements

### Software requirements

* ABAQUS  >= 6.11
* pydicom >= 0.9.7

**NOTES:**

1.  ABAQUS is a commerical software package and requires a license from [Simulia](http://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/overview/)
2.  The authors of bonemapy are not associated with ABAQUS/Simulia 
3.  bonemapy uses both Python and numpy, which are built in to ABAQUS. All of the last few releases of ABAQUS (v6.11 - v6.13) use Python 2.6 and numpy 1.4

### Model setup requirements

* The model must be open in the current viewport
* The model must contain only tetrahedral elements. All 3D stress tetrahedral elements are supported (ABAQUS element types C3D4, C3D4H, C3D10, C3D10H, C3D10I, C3D10M, and C3D10MH).
* Requires that the model coordinates match the CT scan coordinates e.g. the bone model cannot be shifted from its original position

### CT stack requirements ###

* All CT slices should be located in the same directory. This directory must not contain any other file types or slices belonging to other stacks.  
* It is assumed that all slices have the same origin (i.e. same x,y coordinate)

## Installation

bonemapy is an ABAQUS plug-in. ABAQUS plug-ins may be installed in several ways. Only one of the ways is discussed here. For other options the user is referred to the ABAQUS user manuals. 

The ABAQUS GUI is built on Python, and has its own Python installation. This Python installation is not the typically Python setup, so some guidance is provided here on how to install bonemapy's dependencies.

####1. Installation of bonemapy plug-in  

* Download the zip file of the latest bonemapy release
* Unzip the folder (anywhere on your computer). This folder will typically be called `bonemapy-X.X.X`
* Rename this folder to `bonemapy`
* Copy this folder to the `abaqus_plugins` directory within your ABAQUS installation. To complicate matters, this is in a different location depending on the ABAQUS version. For the default ABAQUS installation location, possible locations are:
  + v6.11-1: `C:\SIMULIA\Abaqus\6.11-1\abaqus_plugins`
  + v6.12-1: `C:\SIMULIA\Abaqus\6.12-1\code\python\lib\abaqus_plugins`
  + v6.13-1: `C:\SIMULIA\Abaqus\6.13-1\code\python\lib\abaqus_plugins`

####2. Installation of bonemapy requirements

Currently bonemapy has only one requirement, pydicom, that is not built into ABAQUS. The easiest way of installating this is to:

* Download the zip file of the latest pydicom release from the project web site
* Unzip the folder (anywhere on your computer). This will typically be called `pydicom-X.X.X`
* Within this folder is a sub-folder called `dicom`. Copy the entire `dicom` folder to the ABAQUS python `Lib\site-packages` folder. As noted above for the `abaqus_plugins` directory, the location of this directory depends on the ABAQUS version. Possible locations are:
  + v6.11-1: `C:\SIMULIA\Abaqus\6.11-1\External\Python\Lib\site-packages`
  + v6.12-1: `C:\SIMULIA\Abaqus\6.12-1\tools\SMApy\Lib\site-packages`
  + v6.13-1: `C:\SIMULIA\Abaqus\6.13-1\tools\SMApy\python2.6\Lib\site-packages`
